## Initial Setup

First step is to get the Raspbian image files.

Go to [https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/] and download the image.

I used Raspbian Wheezy (2015-05-05: Kernel version: 3.18).

 > There was a newer Raspbian Jessie available (v4.1) but I couldn't unzip it on
 > my Mac and after an hour of searching it had something to do with limits on
 > Mac unzip utilities, still not sure...  but Wheezy works fine.)

Next step is to prepare the SD card.
